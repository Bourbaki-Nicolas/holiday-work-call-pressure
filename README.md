# Holiday Work-call Pressure
What should I do or react when my boss or customer calls me for work while I am on holiday?

## My Feeling

1. Angry (for their interruption)
2. Sympathetic (towards them for they meet some problems)
3. Resigned (have no choice) (Note:[无奈地](http://language.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202112/08/WS61b02a6fa310cdd39bc7a1a1.html)) 

## Possible Reactions

1. Pretend I miss the call
2. Stop to solve their problems
3. Answer the call and just say I don't want to deal with it
4. Answer the call and say I will participate in their discussion later when I have free time (and the fact is I don't have free time for work when I am off work)

## Evaluation

1. Avoid the problem temporarily but it will not disappear
2. I will feel upset because I give up my precious time
3. I heart the feeling of others and make everyone not happy
4. These show respect to others and delay the problem to the proper time

## Conclusion

Answer the call and say I will participate in their discussion later when I have free time

### Proper ways to do this

1.
